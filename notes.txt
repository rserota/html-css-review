Git and github

git: command line software. runs locally, on one computer, from the terminal. lets us create 'repositories' to track the history of our project.

github.com: just a website that lets you upload git repositories. 

3 zones: work tree (your actual files), staging area (files to be committed), and commit history (all previous commits)

initialize empty repo: git init
add all files to staging area: git add -A
view status of the repo: git status
