Git and github

git: command line software. runs locally, on one computer, from the terminal. lets us create 'repositories' to track the history of our project.

github.com: just a website that lets you upload git repositories. 

3 zones: work tree (your actual files), staging area (files to be committed), and commit history (all previous commits)

initialize empty repo: git init
add all files to staging area: git add -A
view status of the repo: git status

normal workflow: do work, git add -A, git commit -m 'i did work'

go to github.com. click the '+' in the top right. click 'create new repository'.

copy a repo from github that you do not yet have locally: git clone <repo url>
connect a local repo to a remote copy of that repo: git remote add <remote name> <remote url>


less: simple commandline program to read text files. use arrow keys to navigate, q, to quit.
